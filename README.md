 <b>Aim: </b>The main objective of the LMS is to host and track online learning. Providing a virtual hub
where learners can access training resources, an LMS aims to make training accessible for
remote learners and provide a central location for training across an institution or organization.
Additionally, they make learning more streamlined, organized, and cost-effective. An LMS
allows you to manage content, record and measure learning, store learner data, and
communicate with (and enable communication amongst) users.
Furthermore, Learning Management Systems are being used in all stages of life where learning
takes place: from primary, secondary, and higher education to online training and professional
education in the workplace. That said, an LMS can be used for a wide range of industries,
learner levels, and for various uses.
